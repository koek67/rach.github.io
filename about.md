My name is Rachid Belaid, I grew up and studied in Belgium. I recently moved to San Francisco after living in London for 6 years.

I am an experienced software engineer who has worked with a number of technologies, with Python and Postgres in particular being my strong suit. I'm also using Go and Javascript on my day to day programming but love to learn about new technologies whenever better for some problems. I also experiment with technologies like Elixir and Haskell. 

I will be looking for a job in San Francisco from February 2016, so if you are interested in my profile, you can have look at my [CV](http://bit.ly/rachbelaidcv) and contact me.

##OSS Projects

###• Pome

Pome is a Postgres Metrics Dashboard written in Go and using React. You can read more about the project [here](https://github.com/rach/pome)

##Past Projects
Over the last 10 years, I have worked for multiple companies, giving me the chance to work on various projects, including building few new products from the ground up. Not all of these projects were public facing, and some are not live anymore.

Below you can find a few of the projects that I worked on from mid-2013 to 2015, when I co-founded [Lost Property](lostpropertyhq.com), a Tech Agency based in London, which we closed when I moved to San Francisco.

###• Cat in Flat

Cat in a Flat is a cat-sitting platform to connect cat owners in London with potential cat-sitters around them in just a few clicks. You can compare this project to a kind of [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) or [Rover](https://www.rover.com/) to find Cat-sitters.
For this project, I did that full stack development including Ops.

Some of the technologies used are:

- Python
- Pyramid
- SQLAlchemy
- AWS
- PostgreSQL

###• All Things Hair

All Things Hair is a platform filled with hair styling tutorials from leading video bloggers which can be filtered and searched to find that perfect style for you to express yourself. The content isn’t arbitrary however, rather selected based on Google searches. All Things Hair is using Google data to see what customers are searching for and then asks bloggers to make videos to meet the demand.

For this project, I did the followings:
- Worked on Backend, Custom CMS and Admin
- Implemented a document search engine. First using PostgreSQL FTS then using Elastic Search to support Japanese and Russian.
