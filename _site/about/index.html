  <section id="wrapper" class="home about">
    <p>My name is Rachid Belaid, I grew up and studied in Belgium. I recently moved to San Francisco after living in London for 6 years.</p>

<p>I am an experienced software engineer who has worked with a number of technologies, with Python and Postgres in particular being my strong suit. I&#39;m also using Go and Javascript on my day to day programming but love to learn about new technologies whenever better for some problems. I also experiment with technologies like Elixir and Haskell. </p>

<p>I will be looking for a job in San Francisco from February 2016, so if you are interested in my profile, you can have a look at my <a href="http://bit.ly/rachbelaidcv">resume</a> and contact me.</p>

<h2>OSS Projects</h2>

<h3>• Pome</h3>

<p>Pome is a Postgres Metrics Dashboard written in Go and using React. You can read more about the project <a href="https://github.com/rach/pome">here</a></p>

<h3>• Suma</h3>

<p>Suma is microservice to manage and control links to external urls within your project. Suma can be used to block external links from your application to fight spam and phishing attacks, but Suma also can extract information from urls as screenshots, titles, or content to provide previews. You can read more about the project <a href="https://github.com/rach/suma">here</a></p>

<h2>Past Projects</h2>

<p>Over the last 10 years, I have worked for multiple companies, giving me the chance to work on various projects, including building few new products from the ground up. Not all of these projects were public facing, and some are not live anymore.</p>

<p>Below you can find a few of the projects that I worked on from mid-2013 to 2015, when I co-founded <a href="lostpropertyhq.com">Lost Property</a>, a Tech Agency based in London, which we closed when I moved to San Francisco.</p>

<h3>• Cat in Flat</h3>

<p>Cat in a Flat is a cat-sitting platform to connect cat owners in London with potential cat-sitters around them in just a few clicks. You can compare this project to a kind of <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a> or <a href="https://www.rover.com/">Rover</a> to find Cat-sitters.
For this project, I did that full stack development including Ops.</p>

<ul>
<li>Python</li>

<h3>• Warblr</h3>

<p>Launched on Kickstarter, Warblr identifies bird species by listening to their chirps. Similar to song-identifying apps like Shazam and SoundHound, Warblr uses your smartphone to record a nearby bird song and then analyse it to determine the species.

<p>For this project, I did the followings:</p>

<ul>
<li>Worked on Backend, Custom CMS and Admin</li>
